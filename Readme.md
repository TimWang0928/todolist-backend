# My todolist-backend

## Description
A very small Todolist project, which only has some simple pages and functions. Both the front-end and back-end are in my Github. In the future, I will add new things little by little in my free time to build a really useful program.

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
2. Add your MongoDB URI to the `.env` file: MONGODB_URI=mongodb://your-username:your-password@host:port/database

## Getting Started
```bash
npm run start
```
